# Quick Start Guide - Classroom Features

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: No student-facing classroom view
**FIXED**: Students now have a "My Classrooms" tab where they can:
- View all classrooms they've joined
- See classroom details (teacher, subject, grade, description)
- Access classroom content

### Issue 2: Join classroom functionality was broken
**FIXED**: The `joinClassroom()` function now:
- Uses the actual API instead of non-existent `mockDatabase`
- Provides clear error messages for invalid codes
- Shows success messages when joining succeeds
- Awards 5 stars when joining a classroom

### Issue 3: "Copy code doesn't work" message
**FIXED**: Teachers can now:
- Click on any classroom code to copy it instantly
- See a success notification when code is copied
- Get fallback support for older browsers
- Share codes easily with students

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Update the Database

Choose ONE of these methods:

**Method A: Using SQLite Studio or DB Browser**
1. Open your `qualityEducation_new.db` file
2. Run the SQL script from `setup_classrooms.sql`
3. Verify the Classrooms table was created

**Method B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# If you have sqlite3 installed
sqlite3 data/qualityEducation_new.db < setup_classrooms.sql
```

**Method C: Using Entity Framework (if available)**
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddClassrooms
dotnet ef database update
```

### Step 2: Start the Backend API
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Open the Frontend
Open `index.html` in your browser or use your existing web server.
